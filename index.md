## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 1 

  This was one of my favortite labs. This is because of it being our first lab. This is what introduced me to everything and it was fun using cout for the first time.

* Lab 7, part 1 

  This was my second favorite lab by a slim margin. This is because how it talked about dates. That also we implemented arguements and it was fun. It also required us to calculate the differences between dates so it really made us think about it and work extra hard.

* Lab 8, part 1

  This was my third favorite lab. This was because of our use of strings and vectors. This was when I really started to get the hang of vectors and strings. It was fun but also challenging since it was mostly tria; and error.
